# About Me:
Hello, my name is Biridiana Hinojosa. I am 21 years old and was born in the windy city, Chicago. I am located in Charlotte, NC and my eduacation consists of a Highschool Diploma. I also am part of a program called Road to Hire which has taught me the basics of Programming Development. I am interested deeply in front-end development. I love art and visuals, I'd like to be a part of a team where I can continue to grow my skills.

Competitive submissions will explain the problem, identify a solution, and provide measurable outcomes. Use your video and written submission to convince the judges that you have the right idea and the right team to create a lasting, positive impact on the Charlotte community. Submissions with more mature and developed proposals will be given favorable consideration, meaning having a product developed, a proof of concept, or something created will increase your chances of success.
